**Shiny App: mtcars k-mean clustering **

This Shiny app is designed to perform a kmeans clustering on the data set of mtcars. The user can slice and analyse the data in a pair wise format and try different options in specifying the number of clusters. 

The following required inputs from the user. 

- *X Variable*
- *Y Variable*
- *Number of cluster* to be created (Maximum of 5 clusters)

Depending on the inputs the app will cluster the observations into the number of clusters specified.
